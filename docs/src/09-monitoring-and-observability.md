# Monitoring and Observability

## Performance Metrics

**Latency Metrics**:
- Operation latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99, p999)
- Lock contention and wait times
- Page fault rates and memory stalls
- WAL flush latency and throughput

**Throughput Metrics**:
- Operations per second by type
- Memory bandwidth utilization
- Disk I/O patterns and efficiency
- Index lookup performance

## Health Monitoring

**System Health Indicators**:
- Memory pressure and allocation failures
- File system space and inode usage
- Background process health
- Consistency check results

**Alerting Framework**:
- **Critical**: Data corruption, system unavailability
- **Warning**: Performance degradation, capacity limits
- **Info**: Background maintenance, configuration changes

## Debugging and Diagnostics

**Diagnostic Tools**:
- **Memory Map Visualization**: Visual representation of memory layout
- **Transaction Tracing**: Track transaction lifecycle and performance
- **Lock Analysis**: Identify concurrency bottlenecks
- **I/O Profiling**: Analyze disk access patterns
